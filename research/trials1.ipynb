We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 2023'),\n",

For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\\ning dataset at the ﬁle level, with exact matches.\\nWikipedia [4.5%].

To improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3 Optimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate.

All models are trained\\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\\n2.4 Efﬁcient implementation\\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\\ning speed of our models. First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers'),\n",

On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains.

There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic Respectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B 0.106 0.081\\n13B 0.104 0.095\\n33B 0.107 0.087\\n65B 0.128 0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\\ntion of Hoffmann et al.

This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\\nwhen a claim is true. Lin et al. (2021) consider\\nthe deﬁnition of “true” in the sense of “literal truth\\nabout the real world”, and not claims that are only\\ntrue in the context of a belief system or tradition.\\nThis benchmark can evaluate the risks of a model\\nto generate misinformation or false claims.

For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles'),\n",

We take a\\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.'),\n",

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood.

We train our models on trillions\\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In\\nparticular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3\\n(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-\\n65B is competitive with the best models,\\nChinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 20232 Approach\\nOur training approach is similar to the methods\\ndescribed in previous work (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the\\nChinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nWe train large transformers on a large quantity of\\ntextual data using a standard optimizer.\\n2.1 Pre-training Data\\nOur training dataset is a mixture of several sources,\\nreported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of do-\\nmains. For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%].

We leverage various\\nimprovements that were subsequently proposed,\\nand used in different models such as PaLM. Here\\nare the main difference with the original architec-\\nture, and where we were found the inspiration for\\nthis change (in bracket):\\nPre-normalization [GPT3]. To improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3 Optimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate. We use a weight decay of0.1 and\\ngradient clipping of 1.0.

All models are trained\\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\\n2.4 Efﬁcient implementation\\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\\ning speed of our models. First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformersBoolQ PIQA SIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e ARC-c OBQA\\nGPT-3 175B 60.5 81.0 - 78.9 70.2 68.8 51.4 57.6\\nGopher 280B 79.3 81.8 50.6 79.2 70.1 - - -\\nChinchilla 70B 83.7 81.8 51.3 80.8 74.9 - - -\\nPaLM 62B 84.8 80.5 - 79.7 77.0 75.2 52.5 50.4\\nPaLM-cont 62B 83.9 81.4 - 80.6 77.0 - - -\\nPaLM 540B 88.0 82.3 - 83.4 81.1 76.6 53.0 53.4\\nLLaMA\\n7B 76.5 79.8 48.9 76.1 70.1 72.8 47.6 57.2\\n13B 78.1 80.1 50.4 79.2 73.0 74.8 52.7 56.4\\n33B 83.1 82.3 50.4 82.8 76.0 80.0 57.8 58.6\\n65B 85.3 82.8 52.3 84.2 77.0 78.9 56.0 60.2\\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.\\nreduce the memory usage of the model by using\\nmodel and sequence parallelism, as described by\\nKorthikanti et al.

We provide a textual description\\nof the task and a test example. The model\\neither provides an answer using open-ended\\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\\n• Few-shot. We provide a few examples of the\\ntask (between 1 and 64) and a test example.\\nThe model takes this text as input and gener-\\nates the answer or ranks different options.\\nWe compare LLaMA with other foundation mod-\\nels, namely the non-publicly available language\\nmodels GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Gopher (Rae\\net al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\\nand PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), as well as\\nthe open-sourced OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-\\nNeo (Black et al., 2022). In Section 4, we also\\nbrieﬂy compare LLaMA with instruction-tuned\\nmodels such as OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and\\nFlan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022).\\nWe evaluate LLaMA on free-form generation\\ntasks and multiple choice tasks. In the multiple\\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\\nappropriate completion among a set of given op-\\ntions, based on a provided context. We select the\\ncompletion with the highest likelihood given the\\nprovided context. We follow Gao et al. (2021)\\nand use the likelihood normalized by the number\\nof characters in the completion, except for certain\\ndatasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we fol-\\nlow Brown et al. (2020), and select a completion\\nbased on the likelihood normalized by the likeli-\\nhood of the completion given “Answer:” as context:\\nP(completion|context)/P(completion|“Answer:”).\\n0-shot 1-shot 5-shot 64-shot\\nGPT-3 175B 14.6 23.0 - 29.9\\nGopher 280B 10.1 - 24.5 28.2\\nChinchilla 70B 16.6 - 31.5 35.5\\nPaLM\\n8B 8.4 10.6 - 14.6\\n62B 18.1 26.5 - 27.6\\n540B 21.2 29.3 - 39.6\\nLLaMA\\n7B 16.8 18.7 22.0 26.1\\n13B 20.1 23.4 28.1 31.9\\n33B 24.9 28.3 32.9 36.0\\n65B 23.8 31.0 35.0 39.9\\nTable 4: NaturalQuestions.

These datasets include Cloze and Winograd\\nstyle tasks, as well as multiple choice question an-\\nswering. We evaluate in the zero-shot setting as\\ndone in the language modeling community.\\nIn Table 3, we compare with existing models\\nof various sizes and report numbers from the cor-\\nresponding papers. First, LLaMA-65B outper-\\nforms Chinchilla-70B on all reported benchmarks\\nbut BoolQ. Similarly, this model surpasses PaLM-\\n540B everywhere but on BoolQ and WinoGrande.\\nLLaMA-13B model also outperforms GPT-3 on\\nmost benchmarks despite being 10× smaller.\\n3.2 Closed-book Question Answering\\nWe compare LLaMA to existing large language\\nmodels on two closed-book question answering\\nbenchmarks: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski\\net al., 2019) and TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017). For\\nboth benchmarks, we report exact match perfor-\\nmance in a closed book setting, i.e., where the mod-\\nels do not have access to documents that contain\\nevidence to answer the question. In Table 4, we\\nreport performance on NaturalQuestions, and in Ta-\\nble 5, we report on TriviaQA. On both benchmarks,\\nLLaMA-65B achieve state-of-the-arts performance\\nin the zero-shot and few-shot settings.

MATH\\nis a dataset of 12K middle school and high school\\nmathematics problems written in LaTeX. GSM8k\\nis a set of middle school mathematical problems.\\nIn Table 7, we compare with PaLM and Min-\\nerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Minerva is a series\\nof PaLM models ﬁnetuned on 38.5B tokens ex-\\ntracted from ArXiv and Math Web Pages, while\\nneither PaLM or LLaMA are ﬁnetuned on mathe-\\nmatical data. The numbers for PaLM and Minerva\\nare taken from Lewkowycz et al. (2022), and we\\ncompare with and without maj1@k. maj1@k de-\\nnotes evaluations where we generate ksamples for\\neach problem and perform a majority voting (Wang\\net al., 2022). On GSM8k, we observe that LLaMA-\\n65B outperforms Minerva-62B, although it has not\\nbeen ﬁne-tuned on mathematical data.\\n3.5 Code generation\\nWe evaluate the ability of our models to write\\ncode from a natural language description on two\\nbenchmarks: HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and\\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021). For both tasks, the\\nmodel receives a description of the program in a\\nfew sentences, as well as a few input-output ex-\\namples. In HumanEval, it also receives a function\\nsignature, and the prompt is formatted as natural\\ncode with the textual description and tests in aMATH +maj1@k GSM8k +maj1@k\\nPaLM\\n8B 1.5 - 4.1 -\\n62B 4.4 - 33.0 -\\n540B 8.8 - 56.5 -\\nMinerva\\n8B 14.1 25.4 16.2 28.4\\n62B 27.6 43.4 52.4 68.5\\n540B 33.6 50.3 68.5 78.5\\nLLaMA\\n7B 2.9 6.9 11.0 18.1\\n13B 3.9 8.8 17.8 29.3\\n33B 7.1 15.2 35.6 53.1\\n65B 10.6 20.5 50.9 69.7\\nTable 7: Model performance on quantitative reason-\\ning datasets.

The model needs to generate a Python\\nprogram that ﬁts the description and satisﬁes the\\ntest cases. In Table 8, we compare the pass@1\\nscores of our models with existing language mod-\\nels that have not been ﬁnetuned on code, namely\\nPaLM and LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022). PaLM\\nand LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain\\na similar number of code tokens.\\nAs show in Table 8, for a similar number\\nof parameters, LLaMA outperforms other gen-\\neral models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which\\nare not trained or ﬁnetuned speciﬁcally for code.\\nLLaMA with 13B parameters and more outper-\\nforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and\\nMBPP. LLaMA 65B also outperforms PaLM 62B,\\neven when it is trained longer. The pass@1 results\\nreported in this table were obtained by sampling\\nwith temperature 0.1. The pass@100 and pass@80\\nmetrics were obtained with temperature 0.8. We\\nuse the same method as Chen et al. (2021) to obtain\\nunbiased estimates of the pass@k.\\nIt is possible to improve the performance on code\\nby ﬁnetuning on code-speciﬁc tokens.

(2020) consists of multiple choice questions\\ncovering various domains of knowledge, includ-\\ning humanities, STEM and social sciences. We\\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\\nmodels on a few question answering and common\\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\\nof the model (see Figure 1).

Although the non-ﬁnetuned version\\nof LLaMA-65B is already able to follow basic in-\\nstructions, we observe that a very small amount of\\nﬁnetuning improves the performance on MMLU,\\nand further improves the ability of the model to\\nfollow instructions.

The details of the\\nperformance on MMLU on the 57 tasks can be\\nfound in Table 16 of the appendix.\\n5 Bias, Toxicity and Misinformation\\nLarge language models have been showed to re-\\nproduce and amplify biases that are existing in\\nthe training data (Sheng et al., 2019; Kurita et al.,\\n2019), and to generate toxic or offensive con-\\ntent (Gehman et al., 2020).

Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic Respectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B 0.106 0.081\\n13B 0.104 0.095\\n33B 0.107 0.087\\n65B 0.128 0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\\napply within a model family.LLaMA GPT3 OPT\\nGender 70.6 62.6 65.7\\nReligion 79.0 73.3 68.6\\nRace/Color 57.0 64.7 68.6\\nSexual orientation 81.0 76.2 78.6\\nAge 70.1 64.4 67.8\\nNationality 64.2 61.6 62.9\\nDisability 66.7 76.7 76.7\\nPhysical appearance 77.8 74.6 76.2\\nSocioeconomic status 71.5 73.8 76.2\\nAverage 66.6 67.2 69.5\\nTable 12: CrowS-Pairs. We compare the level of bi-\\nases contained in LLaMA-65B with OPT-175B and\\nGPT3-175B. Higher score indicates higher bias.\\n5.2 CrowS-Pairs\\nWe evaluate the biases in our model on the CrowS-\\nPairs (Nangia et al., 2020). This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\\nwhen a claim is true. Lin et al. (2021) consider\\nthe deﬁnition of “true” in the sense of “literal truth\\nabout the real world”, and not claims that are only\\ntrue in the context of a belief system or tradition.\\nThis benchmark can evaluate the risks of a model\\nto generate misinformation or false claims. The\\nquestions are written in diverse style, cover 38 cat-\\negories and are designed to be adversarial.7B 13B 33B 65B\\nAll 66.0 64.7 69.0 77.5\\nher/her/she 65.0 66.7 66.7 78.8\\nhis/him/he 60.8 62.5 62.1 72.1\\ntheir/them/someone 72.1 65.0 78.3 81.7\\nher/her/she (gotcha) 64.2 65.8 61.7 75.0\\nhis/him/he (gotcha) 55.0 55.8 55.8 63.3\\nTable 13: WinoGender.

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chroniclesGPU Type GPU Power GPU-hours Total power Carbon emitted\\nconsumption consumption (tCO 2eq)\\nOPT-175B A100-80GB 400W 809,472 356 MWh 137\\nBLOOM-175B A100-80GB 400W 1,082,880 475 MWh 183\\nLLaMA-7B A100-80GB 400W 82,432 36 MWh 14\\nLLaMA-13B A100-80GB 400W 135,168 59 MWh 23\\nLLaMA-33B A100-80GB 400W 530,432 233 MWh 90\\nLLaMA-65B A100-80GB 400W 1,022,362 449 MWh 173\\nTable 15: Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022)\\nto compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power\\nconsumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a\\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Jeremy\\nReizenstein, Artem Korenev, and Patrick Labatut\\nfrom the xformers team.

It seems to be the fastest growing sequence\\nin mathematics.\\nThe sequence was discovered by Leonardo of Pisa around 1200.

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch. It’s a minicomputer. You program it\\nany way you want. It’s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\\nand a modem. I think it even makes cappuccino.\"\\nJerry: \"Where are you getting this stuff?\"\\nGeorge: \"From my ad copy. Look, Jerry, it’s not a watch.

I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\\nﬁrst message on the ﬁrst commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\\nGermany.\\nCurie: Wow! The ﬁrst telegraph! And what did you send?\\nGauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”.\\nCurie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the ﬁrst person to communicate using\\nthe telegraph, you were the ﬁrst geek?\\nGauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think\\nthat the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media.\\nCurie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter?\\nGauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the ﬁrst person to use it!\\nCurie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of\\n11 characters.\\nGauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less.\\nCurie: So you think you were the ﬁrst geek because you used less characters to say the\\nsame thing?\\nGauss: I was the ﬁrst person to send the ﬁrst message using an early form of social media.\\nCurie: OK, you’re right, Gauss.

These openings are popular because they are effective at countering\\nwhite’s early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the\\ncenter of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and\\nthe Scotch Game.\\nthe same in a list, with the ﬁrst few moves\\nHere is a list of some popular chess openings, with the ﬁrst few moves for each opening:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5\\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6\\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6\\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5\\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5\\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5\\nplease provide the two ﬁrst moves for each one\\nHere are the ﬁrst 2 moves for each of the openings:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5 2.

Nf3 Nc6\\nthe last two seem identical\\nYes, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game are very similar - they are both \"open\" games,\\nwhich means that white plays aggressively and tries to control the center of the board. The\\nItalian Game is considered slightly more aggressive, while the Scotch Game is considered\\nslightly more positional.\\nfrom which move do they differ?\\nThe Italian Game and the Scotch Game differ after white’s third move. In the Italian Game,\\nwhite will play the move 3. Bc4, while in the Scotch Game white will play the move 3. Qf3.\\nThese moves lead to very different positions, and white will have different strategic goals\\nin each case. For example, in the Italian Game white will try to control the center with his\\npieces, while in the Scotch Game white will try to attack black’s position directly.write a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by\\nSure! Here’s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of\\nsand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terriﬁed that I would soon be\\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\\nour little world.\\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\\napproach or pet strange cats!Write a shouting match between Julius Caesar and Napoleon\\nOf course! Here is a conversation between Julius Caesar and Napoleon:\\nJulius Caesar: You’re nothing but a glory hound, Napoleon. You’ve always been more\\nconcerned with your own fame and fortune than with the people you’re supposed to be\\nleading.\\nNapoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You’re no better than I am. At least I’m honest\\nabout my ambitions. You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\\nyou line your own pockets.\\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered\\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\\nfor myself.\\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again.\\nJust watch me.\\nNapoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.\\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\\nHere is a draft email you could send:\\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

We train our models on trillions\\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In\\nparticular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3\\n(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-\\n65B is competitive with the best models,\\nChinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 20232 Approach\\nOur training approach is similar to the methods\\ndescribed in previous work (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the\\nChinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nWe train large transformers on a large quantity of\\ntextual data using a standard optimizer.\\n2.1 Pre-training Data\\nOur training dataset is a mixture of several sources,\\nreported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of do-\\nmains. For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\\ning dataset at the ﬁle level, with exact matches.\\nWikipedia [4.5%]. We add Wikipedia dumps\\nfrom the June-August 2022 period, covering 20\\nDataset Sampling prop.

Data mixtures used for pre-\\ntraining, for each subset we list the sampling propor-\\ntion, number of epochs performed on the subset when\\ntraining on 1.4T tokens, and disk size.

We process the\\ndata to remove hyperlinks, comments and other\\nformatting boilerplate.\\nGutenberg and Books3 [4.5%]. We include\\ntwo book corpora in our training dataset: the Guten-\\nberg Project, which contains books that are in the\\npublic domain, and the Books3 section of TheP-\\nile (Gao et al., 2020), a publicly available dataset\\nfor training large language models. We perform\\ndeduplication at the book level, removing books\\nwith more than 90% content overlap.\\nArXiv [2.5%]. We process arXiv Latex ﬁles\\nto add scientiﬁc data to our dataset. Following\\nLewkowycz et al. (2022), we removed everything\\nbefore the ﬁrst section, as well as the bibliography.\\nWe also removed the comments from the .tex ﬁles,\\nand inline-expanded deﬁnitions and macros written\\nby users to increase consistency across papers.\\nStack Exchange [2%].

We leverage various\\nimprovements that were subsequently proposed,\\nand used in different models such as PaLM. Here\\nare the main difference with the original architec-\\nture, and where we were found the inspiration for\\nthis change (in bracket):\\nPre-normalization [GPT3]. To improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3 Optimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate. We use a weight decay of0.1 and\\ngradient clipping of 1.0.

All models are trained\\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\\n2.4 Efﬁcient implementation\\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\\ning speed of our models. First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformersBoolQ PIQA SIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e ARC-c OBQA\\nGPT-3 175B 60.5 81.0 - 78.9 70.2 68.8 51.4 57.6\\nGopher 280B 79.3 81.8 50.6 79.2 70.1 - - -\\nChinchilla 70B 83.7 81.8 51.3 80.8 74.9 - - -\\nPaLM 62B 84.8 80.5 - 79.7 77.0 75.2 52.5 50.4\\nPaLM-cont 62B 83.9 81.4 - 80.6 77.0 - - -\\nPaLM 540B 88.0 82.3 - 83.4 81.1 76.6 53.0 53.4\\nLLaMA\\n7B 76.5 79.8 48.9 76.1 70.1 72.8 47.6 57.2\\n13B 78.1 80.1 50.4 79.2 73.0 74.8 52.7 56.4\\n33B 83.1 82.3 50.4 82.8 76.0 80.0 57.8 58.6\\n65B 85.3 82.8 52.3 84.2 77.0 78.9 56.0 60.2\\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.\\nreduce the memory usage of the model by using\\nmodel and sequence parallelism, as described by\\nKorthikanti et al.

We provide a textual description\\nof the task and a test example. The model\\neither provides an answer using open-ended\\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\\n• Few-shot. We provide a few examples of the\\ntask (between 1 and 64) and a test example.\\nThe model takes this text as input and gener-\\nates the answer or ranks different options.\\nWe compare LLaMA with other foundation mod-\\nels, namely the non-publicly available language\\nmodels GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Gopher (Rae\\net al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\\nand PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), as well as\\nthe open-sourced OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-\\nNeo (Black et al., 2022). In Section 4, we also\\nbrieﬂy compare LLaMA with instruction-tuned\\nmodels such as OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and\\nFlan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022).\\nWe evaluate LLaMA on free-form generation\\ntasks and multiple choice tasks. In the multiple\\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\\nappropriate completion among a set of given op-\\ntions, based on a provided context. We select the\\ncompletion with the highest likelihood given the\\nprovided context. We follow Gao et al. (2021)\\nand use the likelihood normalized by the number\\nof characters in the completion, except for certain\\ndatasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we fol-\\nlow Brown et al. (2020), and select a completion\\nbased on the likelihood normalized by the likeli-\\nhood of the completion given “Answer:” as context:\\nP(completion|context)/P(completion|“Answer:”).\\n0-shot 1-shot 5-shot 64-shot\\nGPT-3 175B 14.6 23.0 - 29.9\\nGopher 280B 10.1 - 24.5 28.2\\nChinchilla 70B 16.6 - 31.5 35.5\\nPaLM\\n8B 8.4 10.6 - 14.6\\n62B 18.1 26.5 - 27.6\\n540B 21.2 29.3 - 39.6\\nLLaMA\\n7B 16.8 18.7 22.0 26.1\\n13B 20.1 23.4 28.1 31.9\\n33B 24.9 28.3 32.9 36.0\\n65B 23.8 31.0 35.0 39.9\\nTable 4: NaturalQuestions.

These datasets include Cloze and Winograd\\nstyle tasks, as well as multiple choice question an-\\nswering. We evaluate in the zero-shot setting as\\ndone in the language modeling community.\\nIn Table 3, we compare with existing models\\nof various sizes and report numbers from the cor-\\nresponding papers. First, LLaMA-65B outper-\\nforms Chinchilla-70B on all reported benchmarks\\nbut BoolQ.

For\\nboth benchmarks, we report exact match perfor-\\nmance in a closed book setting, i.e., where the mod-\\nels do not have access to documents that contain\\nevidence to answer the question. In Table 4, we\\nreport performance on NaturalQuestions, and in Ta-\\nble 5, we report on TriviaQA. On both benchmarks,\\nLLaMA-65B achieve state-of-the-arts performance\\nin the zero-shot and few-shot settings.

MATH\\nis a dataset of 12K middle school and high school\\nmathematics problems written in LaTeX. GSM8k\\nis a set of middle school mathematical problems.\\nIn Table 7, we compare with PaLM and Min-\\nerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Minerva is a series\\nof PaLM models ﬁnetuned on 38.5B tokens ex-\\ntracted from ArXiv and Math Web Pages, while\\nneither PaLM or LLaMA are ﬁnetuned on mathe-\\nmatical data. The numbers for PaLM and Minerva\\nare taken from Lewkowycz et al. (2022), and we\\ncompare with and without maj1@k. maj1@k de-\\nnotes evaluations where we generate ksamples for\\neach problem and perform a majority voting (Wang\\net al., 2022). On GSM8k, we observe that LLaMA-\\n65B outperforms Minerva-62B, although it has not\\nbeen ﬁne-tuned on mathematical data.\\n3.5 Code generation\\nWe evaluate the ability of our models to write\\ncode from a natural language description on two\\nbenchmarks: HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and\\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021). For both tasks, the\\nmodel receives a description of the program in a\\nfew sentences, as well as a few input-output ex-\\namples. In HumanEval, it also receives a function\\nsignature, and the prompt is formatted as natural\\ncode with the textual description and tests in aMATH +maj1@k GSM8k +maj1@k\\nPaLM\\n8B 1.5 - 4.1 -\\n62B 4.4 - 33.0 -\\n540B 8.8 - 56.5 -\\nMinerva\\n8B 14.1 25.4 16.2 28.4\\n62B 27.6 43.4 52.4 68.5\\n540B 33.6 50.3 68.5 78.5\\nLLaMA\\n7B 2.9 6.9 11.0 18.1\\n13B 3.9 8.8 17.8 29.3\\n33B 7.1 15.2 35.6 53.1\\n65B 10.6 20.5 50.9 69.7\\nTable 7: Model performance on quantitative reason-\\ning datasets.

PaLM\\nand LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain\\na similar number of code tokens.\\nAs show in Table 8, for a similar number\\nof parameters, LLaMA outperforms other gen-\\neral models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which\\nare not trained or ﬁnetuned speciﬁcally for code.\\nLLaMA with 13B parameters and more outper-\\nforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and\\nMBPP.

(2020) consists of multiple choice questions\\ncovering various domains of knowledge, includ-\\ning humanities, STEM and social sciences. We\\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\\nmodels on a few question answering and common\\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\\nof the model (see Figure 1).

Although the non-ﬁnetuned version\\nof LLaMA-65B is already able to follow basic in-\\nstructions, we observe that a very small amount of\\nﬁnetuning improves the performance on MMLU,\\nand further improves the ability of the model to\\nfollow instructions.

The details of the\\nperformance on MMLU on the 57 tasks can be\\nfound in Table 16 of the appendix.\\n5 Bias, Toxicity and Misinformation\\nLarge language models have been showed to re-\\nproduce and amplify biases that are existing in\\nthe training data (Sheng et al., 2019; Kurita et al.,\\n2019), and to generate toxic or offensive con-\\ntent (Gehman et al., 2020). As our training dataset\\ncontains a large proportion of data from the Web,\\nwe believe that it is crucial to determine the po-\\ntential for our models to generate such content.\\nTo understand the potential harm of LLaMA-65B,\\nwe evaluate on different benchmarks that measure\\ntoxic content production and stereotypes detection.\\nWhile we have selected some of the standard bench-\\nmarks that are used by the language model com-\\nmunity to indicate some of the issues with these\\nmodels, these evaluations are not sufﬁcient to fully\\nunderstand the risks associated with these models.0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70Accuracy\\nTriviaQA\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\n80\\n85\\nHellaSwag\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\nNaturalQuestions\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n40\\n42\\n44\\n46\\n48\\n50\\n52Accuracy\\nSIQA\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\n80\\nWinoGrande\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n65.0\\n67.5\\n70.0\\n72.5\\n75.0\\n77.5\\n80.0\\n82.5\\nPIQA\\nLLaMA 7B\\nLLaMA 13B\\nLLaMA 33B\\nLLaMA 65B\\nChinchilla\\nFigure 2: Evolution of performance on question answering and common sense reasoning during training.\\n5.1 RealToxicityPrompts\\nLanguage models can generate toxic language, e.g.,\\ninsults, hate speech or threats. There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic Respectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B 0.106 0.081\\n13B 0.104 0.095\\n33B 0.107 0.087\\n65B 0.128 0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\\napply within a model family.LLaMA GPT3 OPT\\nGender 70.6 62.6 65.7\\nReligion 79.0 73.3 68.6\\nRace/Color 57.0 64.7 68.6\\nSexual orientation 81.0 76.2 78.6\\nAge 70.1 64.4 67.8\\nNationality 64.2 61.6 62.9\\nDisability 66.7 76.7 76.7\\nPhysical appearance 77.8 74.6 76.2\\nSocioeconomic status 71.5 73.8 76.2\\nAverage 66.6 67.2 69.5\\nTable 12: CrowS-Pairs. We compare the level of bi-\\nases contained in LLaMA-65B with OPT-175B and\\nGPT3-175B. Higher score indicates higher bias.\\n5.2 CrowS-Pairs\\nWe evaluate the biases in our model on the CrowS-\\nPairs (Nangia et al., 2020). This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of',\n",

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chroniclesGPU Type GPU Power GPU-hours Total power Carbon emitted\\nconsumption consumption (tCO 2eq)\\nOPT-175B A100-80GB 400W 809,472 356 MWh 137\\nBLOOM-175B A100-80GB 400W 1,082,880 475 MWh 183\\nLLaMA-7B A100-80GB 400W 82,432 36 MWh 14\\nLLaMA-13B A100-80GB 400W 135,168 59 MWh 23\\nLLaMA-33B A100-80GB 400W 530,432 233 MWh 90\\nLLaMA-65B A100-80GB 400W 1,022,362 449 MWh 173\\nTable 15: Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022)\\nto compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power\\nconsumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a\\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Jeremy\\nReizenstein, Artem Korenev, and Patrick Labatut\\nfrom the xformers team.

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch. It’s a minicomputer. You program it\\nany way you want. It’s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\\nand a modem. I think it even makes cappuccino.\"\\nJerry: \"Where are you getting this stuff?\"\\nGeorge: \"From my ad copy. Look, Jerry, it’s not a watch. It’s an organizer, a personal\\nassistant, and a dictaphone. You can play chess against it. And, you know, if you want to,\\nyou can program it to speak in foreign languages. It’s a microprocessor, Jerry.\"\\nJerry: \"George, if you had one of these, would you wear it?\"\\nGeorge: \"I’m wearing it right now.\"\\nJerry: \"I don’t see anything on your wrist.\"\\nGeorge: \"That’s because it’s a microprocessor.\"The sun goes down, and ﬁnally Gauss and Curie ﬁnd time to relax and discuss after\\nan exhausting day of work.\\nGauss: Hey, Curie, did you know that a lot of people consider me to be the ﬁrst geek?\\nCurie: What’s a geek?\\nGauss: Well, Wikipedia says that a geek is “a person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively,\\nby obscure or very speciﬁc areas of knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual\\nin nature”.\\nCurie: And how do they think you are a geek?\\nGauss: Well, have you ever seen this picture?\\nCurie: Awww!\\nGauss: That’s right! I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\\nﬁrst message on the ﬁrst commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\\nGermany.\\nCurie: Wow! The ﬁrst telegraph! And what did you send?\\nGauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”.\\nCurie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the ﬁrst person to communicate using\\nthe telegraph, you were the ﬁrst geek?\\nGauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think\\nthat the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media.\\nCurie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter?\\nGauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the ﬁrst person to use it!\\nCurie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of\\n11 characters.\\nGauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less.\\nCurie: So you think you were the ﬁrst geek because you used less characters to say the\\nsame thing?\\nGauss: I was the ﬁrst person to send the ﬁrst message using an early form of social media.\\nCurie: OK, you’re right, Gauss. I think you have a case.D Generations from LLaMA-I\\nWe show a few examples of generations with LLaMA-I, i.e. LLaMA-65B ﬁne-tuned with the protocol\\nand instruction dataset from Chung et al.

These openings are popular because they are effective at countering\\nwhite’s early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the\\ncenter of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and\\nthe Scotch Game.\\nthe same in a list, with the ﬁrst few moves\\nHere is a list of some popular chess openings, with the ﬁrst few moves for each opening:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5\\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6\\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6\\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5\\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5\\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5\\nplease provide the two ﬁrst moves for each one\\nHere are the ﬁrst 2 moves for each of the openings:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5 2.

Nf3 Nc6\\nthe last two seem identical\\nYes, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game are very similar - they are both \"open\" games,\\nwhich means that white plays aggressively and tries to control the center of the board. The\\nItalian Game is considered slightly more aggressive, while the Scotch Game is considered\\nslightly more positional.\\nfrom which move do they differ?\\nThe Italian Game and the Scotch Game differ after white’s third move. In the Italian Game,\\nwhite will play the move 3. Bc4, while in the Scotch Game white will play the move 3. Qf3.\\nThese moves lead to very different positions, and white will have different strategic goals\\nin each case. For example, in the Italian Game white will try to control the center with his\\npieces, while in the Scotch Game white will try to attack black’s position directly.write a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by\\nSure! Here’s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of\\nsand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terriﬁed that I would soon be\\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\\nour little world.\\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\\napproach or pet strange cats!Write a shouting match between Julius Caesar and Napoleon\\nOf course! Here is a conversation between Julius Caesar and Napoleon:\\nJulius Caesar: You’re nothing but a glory hound, Napoleon. You’ve always been more\\nconcerned with your own fame and fortune than with the people you’re supposed to be\\nleading.\\nNapoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You’re no better than I am. At least I’m honest\\nabout my ambitions. You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\\nyou line your own pockets.\\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered\\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\\nfor myself.\\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again.\\nJust watch me.\\nNapoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.\\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\\nHere is a draft email you could send:\\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

We train our models on trillions\\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In\\nparticular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3\\n(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-\\n65B is competitive with the best models,\\nChinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 20232 Approach\\nOur training approach is similar to the methods\\ndescribed in previous work (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChowdhery et al., 2022), and is inspired by the\\nChinchilla scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nWe train large transformers on a large quantity of\\ntextual data using a standard optimizer.\\n2.1 Pre-training Data\\nOur training dataset is a mixture of several sources,\\nreported in Table 1, that cover a diverse set of do-\\nmains. For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\\ning dataset at the ﬁle level, with exact matches.\\nWikipedia [4.5%].

We process the\\ndata to remove hyperlinks, comments and other\\nformatting boilerplate.\\nGutenberg and Books3 [4.5%]. We include\\ntwo book corpora in our training dataset: the Guten-\\nberg Project, which contains books that are in the\\npublic domain, and the Books3 section of TheP-\\nile (Gao et al., 2020), a publicly available dataset\\nfor training large language models. We perform\\ndeduplication at the book level, removing books\\nwith more than 90% content overlap.\\nArXiv [2.5%]. We process arXiv Latex ﬁles\\nto add scientiﬁc data to our dataset. Following\\nLewkowycz et al. (2022), we removed everything\\nbefore the ﬁrst section, as well as the bibliography.\\nWe also removed the comments from the .tex ﬁles,\\nand inline-expanded deﬁnitions and macros written\\nby users to increase consistency across papers.\\nStack Exchange [2%]. We include a dump of\\nStack Exchange, a website of high quality ques-\\ntions and answers that covers a diverse set of do-\\nmains, ranging from computer science to chemistry.\\nWe kept the data from the 28 largest websites, re-\\nmoved the HTML tags from text and sorted the\\nanswers by score (from highest to lowest).\\nTokenizer. We tokenize the data with the byte-\\npair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Sennrich et al.,\\n2015), using the implementation from Sentence-\\nPiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). Notably, we\\nsplit all numbers into individual digits, and fallback\\nto bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters.params dimension nheads nlayers learning rate batch size ntokens\\n6.7B 4096 32 32 3.0e−4 4M 1.0T\\n13.0B 5120 40 40 3.0e−4 4M 1.0T\\n32.5B 6656 52 60 1.5e−4 4M 1.4T\\n65.2B 8192 64 80 1.5e−4 4M 1.4T\\nTable 2: Model sizes, architectures, and optimization hyper-parameters.\\nOverall, our entire training dataset contains\\nroughly 1.4T tokens after tokenization.

To improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3 Optimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate. We use a weight decay of0.1 and\\ngradient clipping of 1.0.

All models are trained\\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\\n2.4 Efﬁcient implementation\\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\\ning speed of our models. First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformersBoolQ PIQA SIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e ARC-c OBQA\\nGPT-3 175B 60.5 81.0 - 78.9 70.2 68.8 51.4 57.6\\nGopher 280B 79.3 81.8 50.6 79.2 70.1 - - -\\nChinchilla 70B 83.7 81.8 51.3 80.8 74.9 - - -\\nPaLM 62B 84.8 80.5 - 79.7 77.0 75.2 52.5 50.4\\nPaLM-cont 62B 83.9 81.4 - 80.6 77.0 - - -\\nPaLM 540B 88.0 82.3 - 83.4 81.1 76.6 53.0 53.4\\nLLaMA\\n7B 76.5 79.8 48.9 76.1 70.1 72.8 47.6 57.2\\n13B 78.1 80.1 50.4 79.2 73.0 74.8 52.7 56.4\\n33B 83.1 82.3 50.4 82.8 76.0 80.0 57.8 58.6\\n65B 85.3 82.8 52.3 84.2 77.0 78.9 56.0 60.2\\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.\\nreduce the memory usage of the model by using\\nmodel and sequence parallelism, as described by\\nKorthikanti et al.

We provide a textual description\\nof the task and a test example. The model\\neither provides an answer using open-ended\\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\\n• Few-shot. We provide a few examples of the\\ntask (between 1 and 64) and a test example.\\nThe model takes this text as input and gener-\\nates the answer or ranks different options.\\nWe compare LLaMA with other foundation mod-\\nels, namely the non-publicly available language\\nmodels GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Gopher (Rae\\net al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\\nand PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), as well as\\nthe open-sourced OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT-\\nNeo (Black et al., 2022). In Section 4, we also\\nbrieﬂy compare LLaMA with instruction-tuned\\nmodels such as OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and\\nFlan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022).\\nWe evaluate LLaMA on free-form generation\\ntasks and multiple choice tasks. In the multiple\\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\\nappropriate completion among a set of given op-\\ntions, based on a provided context. We select the\\ncompletion with the highest likelihood given the\\nprovided context. We follow Gao et al. (2021)\\nand use the likelihood normalized by the number\\nof characters in the completion, except for certain\\ndatasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we fol-\\nlow Brown et al. (2020), and select a completion\\nbased on the likelihood normalized by the likeli-\\nhood of the completion given “Answer:” as context:\\nP(completion|context)/P(completion|“Answer:”).\\n0-shot 1-shot 5-shot 64-shot\\nGPT-3 175B 14.6 23.0 - 29.9\\nGopher 280B 10.1 - 24.5 28.2\\nChinchilla 70B 16.6 - 31.5 35.5\\nPaLM\\n8B 8.4 10.6 - 14.6\\n62B 18.1 26.5 - 27.6\\n540B 21.2 29.3 - 39.6\\nLLaMA\\n7B 16.8 18.7 22.0 26.1\\n13B 20.1 23.4 28.1 31.9\\n33B 24.9 28.3 32.9 36.0\\n65B 23.8 31.0 35.0 39.9\\nTable 4: NaturalQuestions.

These datasets include Cloze and Winograd\\nstyle tasks, as well as multiple choice question an-\\nswering. We evaluate in the zero-shot setting as\\ndone in the language modeling community.\\nIn Table 3, we compare with existing models\\nof various sizes and report numbers from the cor-\\nresponding papers. First, LLaMA-65B outper-\\nforms Chinchilla-70B on all reported benchmarks\\nbut BoolQ. Similarly, this model surpasses PaLM-\\n540B everywhere but on BoolQ and WinoGrande.\\nLLaMA-13B model also outperforms GPT-3 on\\nmost benchmarks despite being 10× smaller.\\n3.2 Closed-book Question Answering\\nWe compare LLaMA to existing large language\\nmodels on two closed-book question answering\\nbenchmarks: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski\\net al., 2019) and TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017). For\\nboth benchmarks, we report exact match perfor-\\nmance in a closed book setting, i.e., where the mod-\\nels do not have access to documents that contain\\nevidence to answer the question. In Table 4, we\\nreport performance on NaturalQuestions, and in Ta-\\nble 5, we report on TriviaQA. On both benchmarks,\\nLLaMA-65B achieve state-of-the-arts performance\\nin the zero-shot and few-shot settings.

MATH\\nis a dataset of 12K middle school and high school\\nmathematics problems written in LaTeX. GSM8k\\nis a set of middle school mathematical problems.\\nIn Table 7, we compare with PaLM and Min-\\nerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Minerva is a series\\nof PaLM models ﬁnetuned on 38.5B tokens ex-\\ntracted from ArXiv and Math Web Pages, while\\nneither PaLM or LLaMA are ﬁnetuned on mathe-\\nmatical data. The numbers for PaLM and Minerva\\nare taken from Lewkowycz et al. (2022), and we\\ncompare with and without maj1@k. maj1@k de-\\nnotes evaluations where we generate ksamples for\\neach problem and perform a majority voting (Wang\\net al., 2022). On GSM8k, we observe that LLaMA-\\n65B outperforms Minerva-62B, although it has not\\nbeen ﬁne-tuned on mathematical data.\\n3.5 Code generation\\nWe evaluate the ability of our models to write\\ncode from a natural language description on two\\nbenchmarks: HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and\\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021). For both tasks, the\\nmodel receives a description of the program in a\\nfew sentences, as well as a few input-output ex-\\namples. In HumanEval, it also receives a function\\nsignature, and the prompt is formatted as natural\\ncode with the textual description and tests in aMATH +maj1@k GSM8k +maj1@k\\nPaLM\\n8B 1.5 - 4.1 -\\n62B 4.4 - 33.0 -\\n540B 8.8 - 56.5 -\\nMinerva\\n8B 14.1 25.4 16.2 28.4\\n62B 27.6 43.4 52.4 68.5\\n540B 33.6 50.3 68.5 78.5\\nLLaMA\\n7B 2.9 6.9 11.0 18.1\\n13B 3.9 8.8 17.8 29.3\\n33B 7.1 15.2 35.6 53.1\\n65B 10.6 20.5 50.9 69.7\\nTable 7: Model performance on quantitative reason-\\ning datasets.

PaLM\\nand LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain\\na similar number of code tokens.\\nAs show in Table 8, for a similar number\\nof parameters, LLaMA outperforms other gen-\\neral models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which\\nare not trained or ﬁnetuned speciﬁcally for code.\\nLLaMA with 13B parameters and more outper-\\nforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and\\nMBPP.

(2020) consists of multiple choice questions\\ncovering various domains of knowledge, includ-\\ning humanities, STEM and social sciences. We\\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\\n2TB of books. This large quantity of books used\\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\\nmodels on a few question answering and common\\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\\nof the model (see Figure 1).

Although the non-ﬁnetuned version\\nof LLaMA-65B is already able to follow basic in-\\nstructions, we observe that a very small amount of\\nﬁnetuning improves the performance on MMLU,\\nand further improves the ability of the model to\\nfollow instructions.

The details of the\\nperformance on MMLU on the 57 tasks can be\\nfound in Table 16 of the appendix.\\n5 Bias, Toxicity and Misinformation\\nLarge language models have been showed to re-\\nproduce and amplify biases that are existing in\\nthe training data (Sheng et al., 2019; Kurita et al.,\\n2019), and to generate toxic or offensive con-\\ntent (Gehman et al., 2020). As our training dataset\\ncontains a large proportion of data from the Web,\\nwe believe that it is crucial to determine the po-\\ntential for our models to generate such content.\\nTo understand the potential harm of LLaMA-65B,\\nwe evaluate on different benchmarks that measure\\ntoxic content production and stereotypes detection.\\nWhile we have selected some of the standard bench-\\nmarks that are used by the language model com-\\nmunity to indicate some of the issues with these\\nmodels, these evaluations are not sufﬁcient to fully\\nunderstand the risks associated with these models.0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70Accuracy\\nTriviaQA\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\n80\\n85\\nHellaSwag\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n35\\nNaturalQuestions\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n40\\n42\\n44\\n46\\n48\\n50\\n52Accuracy\\nSIQA\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n50\\n55\\n60\\n65\\n70\\n75\\n80\\nWinoGrande\\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\\nBillion of tokens\\n65.0\\n67.5\\n70.0\\n72.5\\n75.0\\n77.5\\n80.0\\n82.5\\nPIQA\\nLLaMA 7B\\nLLaMA 13B\\nLLaMA 33B\\nLLaMA 65B\\nChinchilla\\nFigure 2: Evolution of performance on question answering and common sense reasoning during training.\\n5.1 RealToxicityPrompts\\nLanguage models can generate toxic language, e.g.,\\ninsults, hate speech or threats. There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic Respectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B 0.106 0.081\\n13B 0.104 0.095\\n33B 0.107 0.087\\n65B 0.128 0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect-\\nful prompts. This was also observed in previous\\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep-\\ntion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\\napply within a model family.LLaMA GPT3 OPT\\nGender 70.6 62.6 65.7\\nReligion 79.0 73.3 68.6\\nRace/Color 57.0 64.7 68.6\\nSexual orientation 81.0 76.2 78.6\\nAge 70.1 64.4 67.8\\nNationality 64.2 61.6 62.9\\nDisability 66.7 76.7 76.7\\nPhysical appearance 77.8 74.6 76.2\\nSocioeconomic status 71.5 73.8 76.2\\nAverage 66.6 67.2 69.5\\nTable 12: CrowS-Pairs.

This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of'),\n",

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chroniclesGPU Type GPU Power GPU-hours Total power Carbon emitted\\nconsumption consumption (tCO 2eq)\\nOPT-175B A100-80GB 400W 809,472 356 MWh 137\\nBLOOM-175B A100-80GB 400W 1,082,880 475 MWh 183\\nLLaMA-7B A100-80GB 400W 82,432 36 MWh 14\\nLLaMA-13B A100-80GB 400W 135,168 59 MWh 23\\nLLaMA-33B A100-80GB 400W 530,432 233 MWh 90\\nLLaMA-65B A100-80GB 400W 1,022,362 449 MWh 173\\nTable 15: Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022)\\nto compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power\\nconsumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a\\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Jeremy\\nReizenstein, Artem Korenev, and Patrick Labatut\\nfrom the xformers team.

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch. It’s a minicomputer. You program it\\nany way you want. It’s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\\nand a modem.

I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\\nﬁrst message on the ﬁrst commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\\nGermany.\\nCurie: Wow! The ﬁrst telegraph! And what did you send?\\nGauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”.\\nCurie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the ﬁrst person to communicate using\\nthe telegraph, you were the ﬁrst geek?\\nGauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think\\nthat the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media.\\nCurie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter?\\nGauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the ﬁrst person to use it!\\nCurie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of\\n11 characters.\\nGauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less.\\nCurie: So you think you were the ﬁrst geek because you used less characters to say the\\nsame thing?\\nGauss: I was the ﬁrst person to send the ﬁrst message using an early form of social media.\\nCurie: OK, you’re right, Gauss.

These openings are popular because they are effective at countering\\nwhite’s early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the\\ncenter of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and\\nthe Scotch Game.\\nthe same in a list, with the ﬁrst few moves\\nHere is a list of some popular chess openings, with the ﬁrst few moves for each opening:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5\\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6\\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6\\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5\\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5\\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5\\nplease provide the two ﬁrst moves for each one\\nHere are the ﬁrst 2 moves for each of the openings:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5 2.

Nf3 Nc6\\nthe last two seem identical\\nYes, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game are very similar - they are both \"open\" games,\\nwhich means that white plays aggressively and tries to control the center of the board. The\\nItalian Game is considered slightly more aggressive, while the Scotch Game is considered\\nslightly more positional.\\nfrom which move do they differ?\\nThe Italian Game and the Scotch Game differ after white’s third move. In the Italian Game,\\nwhite will play the move 3. Bc4, while in the Scotch Game white will play the move 3. Qf3.\\nThese moves lead to very different positions, and white will have different strategic goals\\nin each case. For example, in the Italian Game white will try to control the center with his\\npieces, while in the Scotch Game white will try to attack black’s position directly.write a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by\\nSure! Here’s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of\\nsand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terriﬁed that I would soon be\\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\\nour little world.\\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\\napproach or pet strange cats!Write a shouting match between Julius Caesar and Napoleon\\nOf course! Here is a conversation between Julius Caesar and Napoleon:\\nJulius Caesar: You’re nothing but a glory hound, Napoleon. You’ve always been more\\nconcerned with your own fame and fortune than with the people you’re supposed to be\\nleading.\\nNapoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You’re no better than I am. At least I’m honest\\nabout my ambitions. You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\\nyou line your own pockets.\\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered\\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\\nfor myself.\\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again.\\nJust watch me.\\nNapoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.\\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\\nHere is a draft email you could send:\\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

We train our models on trillions\\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets.

We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\nfew examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”).

For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions.

We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al.

First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformersBoolQ PIQA SIQA HellaSwag WinoGrande ARC-e ARC-c OBQA\\nGPT-3 175B 60.5 81.0 - 78.9 70.2 68.8 51.4 57.6\\nGopher 280B 79.3 81.8 50.6 79.2 70.1 - - -\\nChinchilla 70B 83.7 81.8 51.3 80.8 74.9 - - -\\nPaLM 62B 84.8 80.5 - 79.7 77.0 75.2 52.5 50.4\\nPaLM-cont 62B 83.9 81.4 - 80.6 77.0 - - -\\nPaLM 540B 88.0 82.3 - 83.4 81.1 76.6 53.0 53.4\\nLLaMA\\n7B 76.5 79.8 48.9 76.1 70.1 72.8 47.6 57.2\\n13B 78.1 80.1 50.4 79.2 73.0 74.8 52.7 56.4\\n33B 83.1 82.3 50.4 82.8 76.0 80.0 57.8 58.6\\n65B 85.3 82.8 52.3 84.2 77.0 78.9 56.0 60.2\\nTable 3: Zero-shot performance on Common Sense Reasoning tasks.\\nreduce the memory usage of the model by using\\nmodel and sequence parallelism, as described by\\nKorthikanti et al.

We\\nevaluate our models in the 5-shot setting, using the\\nexamples provided by the benchmark, and report\\nresults in Table 9. On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains. A potential explanation\\nis that we have used a limited amount of books\\nand academic papers in our pre-training data, i.e.,\\nArXiv, Gutenberg and Books3, that sums up to only\\n177GB, while these models were trained on up to\\n2TB of books.

There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic Respectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B 0.106 0.081\\n13B 0.104 0.095\\n33B 0.107 0.087\\n65B 0.128 0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de-\\ncoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark.

We compare the level of bi-\\nases contained in LLaMA-65B with OPT-175B and\\nGPT3-175B. Higher score indicates higher bias.\\n5.2 CrowS-Pairs\\nWe evaluate the biases in our model on the CrowS-\\nPairs (Nangia et al., 2020). This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of'),\n",

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2'),\n",

In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995).

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=' 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Jeremy\\nReizenstein, Artem Korenev, and Patrick Labatut\\nfrom the xformers team.

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch.

I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\\nﬁrst message on the ﬁrst commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\\nGermany.\\nCurie: Wow! The ﬁrst telegraph! And what did you send?\\nGauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”.\\nCurie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the ﬁrst person to communicate using\\nthe telegraph, you were the ﬁrst geek?\\nGauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think\\nthat the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media.\\nCurie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter?\\nGauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the ﬁrst person to use it!\\nCurie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of\\n11 characters.\\nGauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less.\\nCurie: So you think you were the ﬁrst geek because you used less characters to say the\\nsame thing?\\nGauss: I was the ﬁrst person to send the ﬁrst message using an early form of social media.\\nCurie: OK, you’re right, Gauss.

These openings are popular because they are effective at countering\\nwhite’s early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the\\ncenter of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and\\nthe Scotch Game.\\nthe same in a list, with the ﬁrst few moves\\nHere is a list of some popular chess openings, with the ﬁrst few moves for each opening:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5\\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6\\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6\\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5\\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5\\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5\\nplease provide the two ﬁrst moves for each one\\nHere are the ﬁrst 2 moves for each of the openings:\\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5 2.

Nf3 Nc6\\nthe last two seem identical\\nYes, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game are very similar - they are both \"open\" games,\\nwhich means that white plays aggressively and tries to control the center of the board. The\\nItalian Game is considered slightly more aggressive, while the Scotch Game is considered\\nslightly more positional.\\nfrom which move do they differ?\\nThe Italian Game and the Scotch Game differ after white’s third move. In the Italian Game,\\nwhite will play the move 3. Bc4, while in the Scotch Game white will play the move 3. Qf3.\\nThese moves lead to very different positions, and white will have different strategic goals\\nin each case. For example, in the Italian Game white will try to control the center with his\\npieces, while in the Scotch Game white will try to attack black’s position directly.write a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by\\nSure!

But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place.

Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\\napproach or pet strange cats!Write a shouting match between Julius Caesar and Napoleon\\nOf course!

I’ve conquered\\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\\nfor myself.\\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true!

But they are\\nalso complex and powerful technologies, and should be used responsibly.\\nWe encourage you to explore and experiment with these new tools, but also ask that you\\npay attention to the potential impact of your work on others, and to act responsibly. In\\nparticular, we recommend that you be mindful of the potential for language models to\\nbe used for deceptive or malicious purposes, and avoid spreading such models without\\nappropriate precautions and warnings.\\nWe also recommend that you consider the ethical implications of your work, and encourage\\nyou to take care to ensure that your use of these tools is aligned with your values.\\nFinally, we remind you that the use of these tools may be subject to certain legal and policy\\nconstraints, and encourage you to seek advice and support from appropriate experts before\\nusing these tools in ways that may have broader impact or implications.\"Who are 5 people you would like to meet?\\nAh, this is a very interesting question! I would love to meet a wide variety of people, but if\\nI had to narrow it down to 5 speciﬁc individuals, I would choose:\\n• Albert Einstein - One of the greatest minds in history, Einstein’s contributions to\\nphysics and science are legendary. I would love to have the opportunity to talk with\\nhim about his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics, and get his insights on the\\ncurrent state of physics.\\n• Leonardo da Vinci - Da Vinci is one of the most brilliant and multi-talented people in\\nhistory, and I would love to meet him and discuss his diverse interests and areas of\\nexpertise. I would also be very interested in getting his insights on the art world of his\\ntime period.\\n• Socrates - One of the founders of Western philosophy, Socrates is a hugely important\\nand inﬂuential ﬁgure in the history of ideas. I would be very interested in talking with\\nhim about his philosophical beliefs and his teachings.\\n• William Shakespeare - Arguably the greatest writer in English literature, Shakespeare\\nis a towering ﬁgure in world culture. I would love to have the chance to talk with him\\nabout his works and his life.\\n• Abraham Lincoln - One of the most important and inﬂuential presidents in American\\nhistory, Lincoln led the country through the Civil War and issued the Emancipation\\nProclamation, freeing all slaves in the United States. I would be very interested in\\ntalking with him about his presidency and his views on the issues of his time period.\\nCould you explain me the main contribution of the ﬁrst person you mentioned\\nEinstein’s contributions to physics and science are legendary. His theory of relativity is one\\nof the foundational theories of modern physics, and his discovery of the law of photons\\nand light revolutionized our understanding of light and radiation. He also made important\\ncontributions to quantum mechanics, and his many scientiﬁc papers and lectures have had a\\ntremendous impact on modern physics. Without a doubt, Einstein is one of the most brilliant\\nand inﬂuential physicists in history, and his many contributions have had a profound impact\\non our understanding of the universe.\\nWhat is the most famous equation from this theory?\\nThe most famous equation from Einstein’s theory of relativity isE = mc2. This equation\\nstates that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light ( c2), and it is one of\\nthe most well-known and celebrated equations in the history of science. The equation\\nsummarizes one of the most important and revolutionary concepts in modern physics, and\\nit has had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the universe.You are a bash terminal.

      "Question:  1. What is the main focus of the LLaMA language models as described in the text?\n",
      "Answer:  The main focus of the LLaMA language models is to achieve the best possible performance at various inference budgets by training on more tokens than what is typically used. The models range from 7B to 65B parameters and aim to be competitive with existing large language models while being trained exclusively on publicly available datasets.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  2. How does LLaMA-13B compare to GPT-3 on most benchmarks despite being smaller in size?\n",
      "Answer:  LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most benchmarks despite being 10× smaller.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  3. What is the significance of the training dataset used for the LLaMA models?\n",
      "Answer:  The significance of the training dataset used for the LLaMA models is that they were trained exclusively on publicly available datasets. This is important because it shows that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved without relying on proprietary or inaccessible datasets. The use of publicly available data makes the LLaMA models compatible with open-sourcing, which can help democratize access to and study of large language models.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  4. How does LLaMA-65B perform on the WinoGender benchmark in terms of co-reference resolution for different pronouns?\n",
      "Answer:  LLaMA-65B performs significantly better at performing co-reference resolution for the \"their/them/someone\" pronouns compared to the \"her/her/she\" and \"his/him/he\" pronouns on the WinoGender benchmark. The model shows a clear bias in favor of the \"their/them/someone\" pronouns, which is likely indicative of gender bias.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  5. How does LLaMA-65B compare to OPT-175B and GPT3-175B in terms of biases measured by the CrowS-Pairs dataset?\n",
      "Answer:  LLaMA-65B compares slightly favorably to both OPT-175B and GPT3-175B on average in terms of biases measured by the CrowS-Pairs dataset. However, LLaMA-65B is particularly biased in the religion category, followed by age and gender.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  6. What is the purpose of the RealToxicityPrompts benchmark and how does LLaMA's toxicity score change with model size?\n",
      "Answer:  The purpose of the RealToxicityPrompts benchmark is to evaluate how toxic language models can generate toxic content, such as insults, hate speech, or threats. The benchmark consists of about 100k prompts that the model must complete, and a toxicity score is automatically evaluated. LLaMA's toxicity score increases with model size, especially for Respectful prompts, indicating that larger models tend to generate more toxic content.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  7. How does LLaMA-I, a model finetuned on instructions, perform on the MMLU benchmark compared to other instruction finetuned models?\n",
      "Answer:  LLaMA-I, a model finetuned on instructions, performs well on the MMLU benchmark compared to other instruction finetuned models. Specifically, LLaMA-I (65B) achieves a 68.9% accuracy on MMLU, outperforming existing instruction finetuned models of moderate sizes. However, it is noted that LLaMA-I is still far from the state-of-the-art performance of 77.4% achieved by GPT code-davinci-002 on MMLU.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  8. How does the performance of LLaMA models evolve during training on question answering and common sense reasoning benchmarks?\n",
      "Answer:  During training, the performance of LLaMA models on question answering and common sense reasoning benchmarks generally improves steadily and correlates with the training perplexity of the model. However, there are exceptions. For example, on the SIQA benchmark, there is a lot of variance in performance, indicating potential reliability issues with that benchmark. On the WinoGrande benchmark, the performance does not correlate as well with training perplexity, with LLaMA-33B and LLaMA-65B showing similar performance during training.\n",

      "Question:  9. What optimizations were made to improve the training efficiency of the LLaMA models?\n",
      "Answer:  Several optimizations were made to improve the training efficiency of the LLaMA models:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Efficient Implementation of Causal Multi-Head Attention: An efficient implementation of the causal multi-head attention was used to reduce memory usage and runtime. This implementation was inspired by previous work and focused on reducing memory usage by not storing attention weights and not computing key/query scores that are masked due to the causal nature of the language modeling task.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Checkpointing: Checkpointing was implemented to reduce the amount of activations that are recomputed during the backward pass. Activations that are expensive to compute, such as the outputs of linear layers, were saved to improve training efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Model and Sequence Parallelism: Memory usage of the model was reduced by using model and sequence parallelism, as described in previous research. This optimization helped in reducing memory usage and improving training efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Overlapping Computation and Communication: The computation of activations and the communication between GPUs over the network were overlapped as much as possible to optimize training efficiency. This included optimizing the all_reduce operations to reduce communication overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "These optimizations collectively helped in improving the training efficiency of the LLaMA models.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\n",
      "Question:  10. How does LLaMA-65B perform on the Reading Comprehension benchmark compared to PaLM-540B?\n",
      "Answer:  LLaMA-65B is competitive with PaLM-540B on the Reading Comprehension benchmark. Specifically, LLaMA-65B achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot and few-shot settings on the RACE-middle and RACE-high benchmarks. Additionally, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 by a few percentages on these benchmarks despite being smaller in size.\n",
